This project was created as a part of the Software Processes & Modelling module during the first year of my study at Bath university. 

The task was to develop anything within the domain of Personal Informatics (PI), the only restrictions being we had to use agile methodology - including holding SCRUM meetings, keeping a product backlog etc. 

My group decided to produce the prototype of an app developed to help users understand more about how they can improve the quality of their day through rating their productivity and sleep each day, as well as being able to log a diary entry each day. The code files present are our final versions of the code that were used to show how our system would work.

To run the program through the command line, you can install the code files navigate to where the code is installed and enter python3 HomeScreen.py. In an IDE, running HomeScreen.py file will start the program. 

To understand the code in more detail, you can read through the 'Software Modelling Course - Report' file, which goes into a lot more detail about the project, including test cases and the ways in which my team worked in an agile way.
